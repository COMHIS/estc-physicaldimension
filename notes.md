For single sheet items write 1 sheet in $a, and
give the proportion (as nearly as you can) of the item in question to a whole
sheet of the period, expressed as a fraction: l/20, 1/40, 1/80. For example,
a 1/20 will be approximately the size of a sheet from a folio with vertical
chain-lines. Where no attempt to determine the fraction of a whole sheet
can be made give the measurements in mm., height before width.
