# TODO

The data still has some 1to sizes although they should be interpreted as 2fo?

TT notes in [estc_dimensions_observations.docx](estc_dimensions_observations.docx)

In order to save space, make table with unique entries that can be cross-linked to documents.

Now some empty lines are omitted. Fix this too. Perhaps solved with the interlinking already.

### Dimensions

  * Compare ready made sheets and calculated estimates; these have
    notable differences, why?
  * Augment missing values using our estimates, not the ready made sheet 
  * Account for year and publication place if feasible as the sizes may vary
