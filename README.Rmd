# ESTC physical_dimension

This repository is part of the ESTC data unification project by Helsinki Computational History Group ([COMHIS](https://comhis.github.io/)). 

It provides code for processing the physical_dimension (gatherings / book formats) information found in the English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC) and outputs unified and unique data for the ESTC documents.




## Input

### ESTC

The main input is the [parsed MARC data](https://github.com/COMHIS/estc-data-private/blob/master/estc-csv-raw/estc_parsed.csv.gz).

The fields used are:
* physical_dimension


## Data processing

Run the script [main.R](main.R) to convert the raw MARC data into the
final table of harmonized document dimensions. This will read in the
data, harmonize the data, and finally write summary files.

**Running time** is just a few minutes on a normal laptop.


## Output

[Summary file](physical_dimension.md) provides an overview of the harmonized data, and includes links to further
auxiliary files (figures, CSV tables)

The output data tables are available and described in [COMHIS/estc-data-private](https://github.com/COMHIS/estc-data-private/tree/master/estc-physicaldimension).


## Software version
