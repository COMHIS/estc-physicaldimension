# ESTC Physical Dimension

This repository is part of the ESTC data unification project by
Helsinki Computational History Group
([COMHIS](https://comhis.github.io/)).


## Output

The workflow provides code and outcomes for processing the physical dimension
(gatherings / book formats) information found in the English Short
Title Catalogue (ESTC).

 - [Automated summaries](physical_dimension.md): overview of harmonization and links to supporting data
 - [Output data tables](https://github.com/COMHIS/estc-data-unified/tree/master/estc-physicaldimension).


## Input

After setup, the **running time** is just a few minutes on a normal laptop.

### ESTC


### Input data preparation steps

Update the required data folders from Git:
  - estc-data-unified
  - estc-data-verified

The main input is the [parsed and prefiltered MARC data](https://github.com/COMHIS/estc-data-verified/blob/master/estc-csv-raw-filtered/estc_raw_sane.csv).

Use the [ESTC field picker](https://github.com/COMHIS/estc-raw-csv-prepicker) is used to pick the field 300a (physical dimension) separately. The branch antagomir-physicaldimension contains the Python scripts that were used to generate the parsed data file out/fields_picked_300a.csv Run "python3 fieldpicker_main.py" and check that file paths are ok.


## Data processing

Run the script [main.R](main.R) to convert the raw MARC data into the
final table of harmonized document dimensions. This will read in the
data, harmonize the data, and finally write summary files.
